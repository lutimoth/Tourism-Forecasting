# Tourism Forecasting Project

This is a capstone project that is a work in progress. It will aim to provide TSA forecasting for Tourism Data.

There is a requirements file in the main github folder. It is recommended to create a separate environment for pycaret due to the dependencies needed at the time for pycaret 2.3 and the pycaret nightly 2.2.2. In the [Requirements and Docs](/main/Requirements%20and%20Docs) folders are different requirements.txt in the event that someone wishes to create a custom environment for pycaret.
