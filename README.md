# Tourism Forecasting Project

This is a capstone project that is a work in progress. It will aim to provide TSA forecasting for Tourism Data.

There is a requirements file in the main github folder. It is recommended to create a separate environment for pycaret due to the dependencies needed at the time for pycaret 2.3 and the pycaret nightly 2.2.2. In the [Requirements and Docs](/main/Requirements%20and%20Docs) folders are different requirements.txt in the event that someone wishes to create a custom environment for pycaret.

Within [Proposal and Reports](/main/Proposal%20and%20Reports) we have the pycaret model results which gives metrics data. Due to the volume of models, the parameters utilized for each model can be found within the [Preprocessing and Modeling notebook](/main/Notebooks/Pre-process%20and%20Modeling%20for%20New%20Zealand%20Forecasting%20Data.ipynb) right by each model.
